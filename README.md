# GAS-KF
The GAS-KF codes facilitate the simulation and estimation of parameters in time-varying time series models by employing a score-driven method framework. This approach utilizes a Kalman filter applied to the state-space representation of a truncated moving average process, enabling efficient parameter tracking and dynamic modeling of evolving time series data.
